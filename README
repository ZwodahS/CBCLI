Chrome Bookmarks Command Line Interface (CBCLI)

Provide a basic cmdline for searching chrome bookmarks and opening the links directly.

To search your bookmarks use

cbcli -r regex strings ...
cbcli -s string keyword token ...

After that, it will display a list of name and their urls.

To open them, call

cbcli -o <number>
