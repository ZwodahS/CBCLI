Chrome Bookmarks Command Line Interface (CBCLI)

Provide a basic cmdline for searching chrome bookmarks and opening the links directly from terminal.

To search your bookmarks use

cbcli -r regex
cbcli string1 string2

After that, it will display a list of name and their urls.

To open them, call

cbcli -o <number> 

Other options includes
-i : display your bookmarks information
-d : display directory path when displaying the results.

Possible extension to the project
(a.k.a things to add when I am bored)
- List the last search history
- Extension to linux/window (if I am really bored)
- Bookmark management function
    - CRUD bookmarks from cli
    - Match certain keywords and move/duplicate them into a folder
- Cache the parsed data, and use checksum to detect if there is changes. This will be useful only if the bookmarks get too big and parsing takes too long. For now, it really doesn't matter.

Currently this only supports OSX but shouldn't be hard to add support for Windows/Linux.
