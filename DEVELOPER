If you are reading this means that you are interested in adding to this project.

The code is in a mess since it was just pieced together to just get it to work. The naming convention for the functions are pretty bad. Some are in lowerCamelCase while some follow the python underscore naming convention. 
Feel free to change them if they irritate you.
